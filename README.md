## Life Cycle & Processes 
Depending on the goal of your project, choose one of the following.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 * iterative: explore, finding, explore, finding, ...
 * use statistics and figures
 * tools: Jupyter notebook or Matlab

2. Algorithm design 
 * theory oriented with more math
 * tools: pencil and paper, white board, Matlab, Jupyter + PyCharm
 
3. Automotive

 * DO-331 Model-Based Development and Verification Supplement to DO-178C and DO-278A



## Two pillars for high quality code

### 1. Unit test
Take responsibility for your code!


* Python [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)

### 2. Review
Improve quality by teamwork!
